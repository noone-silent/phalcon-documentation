# Docker

## Introduction

Since Version 5.9.2, we provide production-ready docker images for your convenience.  
By default, the Docker images run as user `phalcon` in group `phalcon` and `UID` and `GID` 1000.

You can override those values by providing a different user and group in your docker compose or stack file.  
You also can use our [Dockerfile](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) to permanently
change those values.

## How to download?

We provide our Docker images on the Docker Hub and GitHub. See the following table for the addresses:

| Provider   | Pull command example                                 |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Docker Hub | `docker pull phalconphp/cphalcon:v5.9.2-php8.4`      |   
| GitHub     | `docker pull ghcr.io/phalcon/cphalcon:v5.9.2-php8.4` |

!!! info "NOTE"

    We do not provide a "latest" tag on our Docker images.

The tag for our Docker images has the following build: `v[Phalcon Release]-php[PHP Version]`  
As example: If you want to install Phalcon Version 5.8.0 on PHP 8.2, the tag would be: `v5.8.0-php8.2`

## How do we build the docker images?

As the base we use the official PHP FPM docker image based on Debian Linux.
We integrate a basic healthcheck and all configurations needed to run a basic Phalcon application.

Take a look at our [Dockerfile](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) for more details.

## Extending the Docker image

The provided Docker image is usually all you need to run a basic Phalcon application.
For more advanced applications, you maybe need to install another extension.

Let's say you want to install the `memcached` extension. Phalcon provides an easy way to do so:

```dockerfile
FROM phalconphp/cphalcon:v5.9.2-php8.4

RUN set -eux \
  && install-php-extensions memcached
```

For a full list of supported extensions using this method, please see the [Documentation](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer#supported-php-extensions).  
For other extensions not covered by this method, please see the official PHP Docker image [Documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/).

## Notes

We provide production-ready images. That means we do not install anything else you might need in a local development
environment. For example, we do not have installed `curl` or `composer`. This minimizes the possibility to download
malicious content inside your docker image. We also do not install `xdebug` or tools like `top` or `git`.

## Credits

We want to thank the following people for providing us with tools for building production-ready docker images:

[PHP](https://github.com/php/)
: The PHP Team for providing us the base image including the newest PHP Versions.

[mlocati](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer)
: For providing an even better PHP extension installer and a lot of supported extensions.

[renatomefi](https://github.com/renatomefi/php-fpm-healthcheck)
: For the FPM healthcheck script.
